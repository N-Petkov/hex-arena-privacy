        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Hex Arena · Effective date: February 14, 2026</p>

        <p>This privacy policy describes how Hex Arena ("the App", "we", "us") handles information when you use our
            mobile application.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <p><strong>We do not collect personal information directly.</strong> The App does not require account creation,
            login, or any form of registration. No names, email addresses, or phone numbers are collected.</p>

        <p>However, the following data may be collected automatically by third-party services integrated into the App:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Advertising ID</strong> — A resettable, anonymous device identifier used by Google AdMob to
                serve relevant advertisements.</li>
            <li><strong>Ad interaction data</strong> — Information about which ads are viewed and clicked, collected by
                Google AdMob.</li>
            <li><strong>Basic device information</strong> — Device type, operating system version, and general location
                (country/region level) for ad targeting purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>

        <p>The App uses the following third-party services that may collect data independently:</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Google AdMob</strong> — Used to display advertisements. AdMob may collect device identifiers, ad
                interaction data, and approximate location for ad personalization. See <a
                    href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a> and <a
                    href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank">how Google uses data from
                    partner apps</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>PeerJS (WebRTC)</strong> — Used for peer-to-peer multiplayer functionality. When you play online
                PvP, a temporary connection is established directly between players using WebRTC. The PeerJS signaling
                server facilitates this connection but does not store gameplay data. See <a href="https://peerjs.com/"
                    target="_blank">PeerJS</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Local Data Storage</h2>

        <p>The App stores gameplay progress, settings, and in-game currency locally on your device using browser local
            storage. This data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Never leaves your device</li>
            <li>Is not transmitted to any server</li>
            <li>Is not accessible by us or any third party</li>
            <li>Can be deleted by clearing the app's data or uninstalling the App</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>

        <p>The App is <strong>not directed at children under the age of 13</strong>. We do not knowingly collect
            personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided
            personal data through the App, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>

        <p>We do not sell, trade, or share any user data. The only data sharing that occurs is through the third-party
            SDKs described in Section 2 (Google AdMob), which operate under their own privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ad personalization</strong> — You can opt out of personalized ads by adjusting your device's
                advertising settings (Settings → Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization).</li>
            <li><strong>Reset Advertising ID</strong> — You can reset your advertising identifier at any time through
                your device settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Delete local data</strong> — You can delete all locally stored game data by clearing the app's
                storage or uninstalling.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Security</h2>

        <p>Since we do not collect or store personal data on our servers, the risk of data breaches from our side is
            minimal. All multiplayer connections use WebRTC, which employs end-to-end encryption by default.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>

        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an
            updated effective date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
        </p>
